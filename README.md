# Playing-with-ROCm

Here to show my experience about playing with ROCm with runable code, step-by-step tutorial to help you reproduce what I have did. If you have iGPU or dGPU of AMD, you may try Machine Learning with them. 


## Topics
### Training
#### Finetuning
- [LoRA with Radeon](./training/W7900_LoRA_Demo.ipynb)
- [QLoRA with Radeon](./training/W7900_QLoRA_Demo.ipynb)

### Inference
- [Deploy LLM with Radeon iGPU 780M](./inference/LLM/Run Ollama with AMD iGPU 780M-QuickStart.pdf)
